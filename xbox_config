# Evdev Example
# =============
#
# Xboxdrv allows to not only the use of Xbox1 and Xbox360 controllers,
# but also every other controller supported by Linux. To use them they
# have however to be remapped to the Xbox360 button layout. While this
# process is a bit chumbersome, such a configuration can be reused and
# layout on top of regular xboxdrv configuration, i.e. if you store
# your evdev to Xbox360 in the file evdev.xboxdrv and your custom
# xboxdrv configuration in xbox360.xboxdrv you can use them both at
# the same time with:
# 
#   xboxdrv -c evdev.xboxdrv -c xbox360.xboxdrv
#
# The following example is for the Microsoft Sidewinder Precision 2
# joystick.

[xboxdrv]
# Using the 'by-id' name is recomment, as it is static, while an
# /dev/input/eventX name can change depending on what other USB
# devices you use.
evdev = /dev/input/event2

# This displays events received from the controller, if you are
# working on a configuration you want to set this to true:
evdev-debug = false
silent = true

# Grabbing the device prevents other applications from accessing it,
# this is needed most of the time te prevent applications from
# receiving events twice.
evdev-grab = true
